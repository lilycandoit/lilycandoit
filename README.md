### Hi, I'm Lily (or Lì) 👋

I’m a full-stack software engineering student at Holberton School Australia, learning by building and collaborating on real projects.

My close friends call me **Lì** — it means *refuse to give up*, and that mindset carries me through every challenge I face in tech.

Before this, I worked in digital marketing for tech. Curiosity led me to code — and I haven’t looked back.

I love figuring out how things work behind the scenes and building tools that make life easier or more fun.

<br>

🌱 When I’m not coding, I enjoy writing, learning about myself, exploring AI tools, and spending time in nature.
